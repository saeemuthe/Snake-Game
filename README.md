# Snake-Game
To create a graphical snake game in C++ using SFML or SDL, start by setting up your development environment with the necessary libraries. Implement the game loop, handle user input for snake movement, and incorporate sound effects for actions like eating food. For increasing difficulty, adjust the snake's speed or add obstacles as the score increases.
